# PiLENS: Raspberry Pi–Based Deep Learning Enhanced Nightvision Surveillance System
*An IoT-based AI system for real-time suspicious activity detection using YOLO, CNN, LSTM on Raspberry Pi with nightvision camera. Features multi-mode alerts, secure remote access, and selective storage*
</br>
</br>

## Overview

PiLENS is a low-cost, portable, and intelligent surveillance system designed to enhance real-time security monitoring in low-light and night-time environments. The system leverages Raspberry Pi hardware, IR cameras, and deep learning-based AI models to detect suspicious activities automatically, providing instant alerts to the user. By combining edge computing, computer vision, and night vision technology, PiLENS aims to offer an affordable alternative to traditional high-end surveillance systems.

Key components include:
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM) as the core processor, Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (12MP NOIR with IR LEDs for nightvision), LEDs and buzzer for local alerts.
- Software: Ultralytics YOLO for person detection, CNN for feature extraction, LSTM for sequence analysis, and Flask for remote MJPEG streaming.
- Features: Multi-mode detection (basic person alert, intruder face recognition, advanced suspicious analysis), selective storage of suspicious clips, and secure remote access via Tailscale.
- Performance: Runs at 5 FPS to balance heavy ML processing on low-power hardware.

This project aims to provide a low-cost, portable solution for enhanced security, with potential extensions for audio detection and long-range wireless connectivity.


### Problem Statement:

- Traditional surveillance systems often face the following challenges:
- High costs of professional security cameras and monitoring infrastructure

- Python and OpenCV for video processing and preprocessing
- Optional Flask/Dashboard for remote monitoring
- Alert system via buzzer, email, or mobile notification

**3. Key Capabilities:**

- Detects humans and suspicious behaviors in real-time
- Operates reliably in low-light/night conditions
- Minimal false alarms due to AI-based detection
- Portable, low-cost setup suitable for universities, offices, homes, and restricted areas


### Core Features:

- Real-time AI-based detection of suspicious activities
- Night vision enabled through IR camera and LEDs
